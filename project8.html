					The customers have been experiencing difficulty in navigating the website, so Holly and her team should look at how they can improve the website's design and page layout.It's time to see what the competition is up to. Take ten minutes out of your day and use a search engine to research the following terms: 1. A business name - this will show you the competition for keywords and branding. 2. A product or service - this will show you who the competition is for that product or service. 3. Include your location - this highlights competitors who are local to you, that offer the same services. These searchable terms are 'keywords' that are associated with a brand or product. These keywords are what people will use to find a business or product online, so it's important to know who or what else appears when customers search the web.
